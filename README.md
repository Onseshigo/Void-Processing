# Void-Processing
A space age extension mod, right after promethium science. This adds a whole new tier of science, focused on matter/reality manipulation.

This features late game challenges where your interplanetary logistics skills will be tested, featuring challenges from all planets.

Your reward? Master the art of quality products with a final quality tier, and boost your science production with a favorable alternative to quality cycling

- ✔️ Compatible with any save
- ✔️ No yet another planet mod
- ✔️ No content dependancies
- ✔️ AI less
- ❌ Won't laught at you for not finishing space age

## Development progress

Currently, only part one is complete, which focuses on creating void cores.
The two other parts will focus on science production, and then that science's technology

## Credits

- Finely Crafted Machines for the void assembler and void synthetizer textures
- [factorio-mod-template](https://github.com/fgardt/factorio-mod-template) for the CI

## Reusing content

You can reuse all the content of this mod. This mean you can take part of it to create your own mod, or a direct fork of this mod. However, you respect those rules:
- Non code assets use the factorio's asset policy. This means that you can only reuse them for factorio mods
- Any usage must have a link back to this mod (You can stick them in the README like above and it will be fine)
