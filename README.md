Your reward? Master the art of quality products with a final quality tier, and boost your science production with a favorable alternative to quality cycling

- ✔️ Compatible with any save

- ✔️ Not yet another planet mod
- ✔️ No AI used
- ❌ Won't laugh at you for not finishing space age

## Compatibility

For mod compatibility, please check [the compatibility list](./COMPATIBILITY.md). If a mod isn't on there and is incompatible, please make an issue!

## Development progress

Currently, only part one is complete, which focuses on creating void cores.
The two other parts will focus on science production, and then that science's technology (aka quality)

## Credits

- Hurricane for the void assembler and void synthetizer textures
- [factorio-mod-template](https://github.com/fgardt/factorio-mod-template) for the CI

## Reusing content

You can reuse all the content of this mod. This mean you can take part of it to create your own mod, or a direct fork of this mod. However, you respect those rules:
- Non code assets use the factorio's asset policy. This means that you can only reuse them for factorio mods
- Any usage must have a link back to this mod (You can stick them in the README like above and it will be fine)
- Any assets not made for this mod (E.G. The void assembler) must respect the original author's policy
