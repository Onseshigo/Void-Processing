## Licensing

Since there is no special license to keep assets in the factorio community, this mod got a special type of licensing.

The code is licensed under [MIT](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

Graphics and sounds are distributed under [GPLv3](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/), with some key points
- Edited assets from factorio keep the Factorio's asset policy. This means that you can only reuse them for factorio mods
- If you use / edit my assets in a factorio mod, only those assets are affected by GPLv3. Not the other assets used
- Any assets not made for this mod (E.G. The void assembler) must respect the original author's policy
- Usage of the assets outside of Factorio modding is forbidden (But you can still ask for permission :))

I do not know how much legal foothold this licensing got, but please be respectful. And in any doubt, don't hesitate to contact me

Assets can also be found [here](https://github.com/RustyNova016/Factorio-Assets)
