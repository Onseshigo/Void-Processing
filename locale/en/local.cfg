[item-description]
void-core-inert=A void core that is completly spent. It needs to be recharged in space
void-bacteria=Bacterias mutated to be able to turn objects into void. It cannot survive long out of its substrate.
void-science-pack=When you stare at the void science pack, the void science pack ask you to put it in that damn lab already.

# Trash
unstable-void-matter=Void matter that is too unstable to be used for anything. Best you can do is recycle it
